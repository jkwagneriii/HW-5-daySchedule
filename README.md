HW # 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This day schedule will react dynamically with you depending on what time of day it is! Never wonder, "is it 1? is it 2?", simply glance at your calander and let the red color signal you in the right direction. 
Want to save some info for 4pm? Go ahead and type in whatever you want and hit that save button! As long as you are on your device, the schedule will remember what you have saved. 

Using Moment.js was confusing at first because there was so much info. However, the documentation supplied a ton of Q&A's, probably because it's been around for so long. 
This video helped me get started when it came to using moment to actually display something.

After working through my functions in my tutor session, the order of working through JS FINALLLY started to click a bit more. I still have a long way to go, but knowing that I had to make the app check the time of day and have it return a class name into a text area is enough to get me stoked on this assignment and want to keep pushing through.
