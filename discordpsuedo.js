//First link all files and API's together properly. 
//This means bootstrap, .js, Moment.js

// Gonna try to dip into the html before JS
//If using form from bootstrap, we would first go in and figure out the rows and columns.

//FIRST FIRST lets get text to display inside the <p>
//First task on the page is to get the date to display./////We'll use .text to get the API data to appear in the   <p id="currentDay"> tag. 

//Create timeblocks and buttons with bootstrap. BREAKDOWN
//Each row has 3 columns 
//Column 1 is the time (static)
//Column 2 is the form (bootstrap) and will be working with Moment.js to get the current time of day
//Column 3 is the button which will be working with local storage

// This will be syntax used while working with Moment.js
// moment().year(year).month(month).date(day)
